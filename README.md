# TrainHeroic Dashboard

A web application for visualizing and analyzing your TrainHeroic workout data.

## Description

TrainHeroic Dashboard provides a comprehensive interface for TrainHeroic users to:

- View and search through your workout history
- Analyze exercise performance over time
- Track volume and progress metrics
- Export your workout data in various formats

TrainHeroic doesn't have a web app or any way to export workout data, so this project fills that gap.
